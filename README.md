The README 
So this is my second attempt at the trying to pull requests to master branch 
Hopefully this goes well :)
---------------------------
This is another commit to later be pull requested and merged
---------------------------
I will edit this but not merge it and see how that goes. 
---------------------------
Just gonna try to write 1 commit a day, it'd be cool to code, but don't know where to start
---------------------------
Maybe this can turn into a journal type lol. If anyone sees this they will be so confused haha. 
I checked the btc ann and that cpuminerdev guy accused cryptozenny of having an alt account to MY comment LOL 
Discord chat was added and we got a new pool so that is cool, though perhaps more people will join now but that can be a good and bad thing. 
---------------------------
Oh boy was yesterday an eventful day, the word is out, the gloves are off. Mink aka cpuminerdev has been exposed and rightfully so. Now time to be on the defensive and try to look out for fake btc ann posts or report anns by him saying calling others and us a scam. 
---------------------------
Wow have things taken for the worst. M?nk guy is crazy, the discord is gone, my and zenny's discord accounts are gone, now telegram became temporary home and plan is to move to new forum, it is 3:27. Later tonight around 10pm is morning 8am in Russia, final tweaks are to be made and it will be done. 
---------------------------
Forum is up and i have not seen activity about m?nk on btc ann for a while, the forum looks really great
