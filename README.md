The README 
So this is my second attempt at the trying to pull requests to master branch 
Hopefully this goes well :)
---------------------------
This is another commit to later be pull requested and merged
---------------------------
I will edit this but not merge it and see how that goes. 
---------------------------
Just gonna try to write 1 commit a day, it'd be cool to code, but don't know where to start
---------------------------
Maybe this can turn into a journal type lol. If anyone sees this they will be so confused haha. 
I checked the btc ann and that cpuminerdev guy accused cryptozenny of having an alt account to MY comment LOL 
Discord chat was added and we got a new pool so that is cool, though perhaps more people will join now but that can be a good and bad thing.
